I would say the best time to visit there is in summer in australiam and it would mbe winter there in thailand. The weather there is great and always is a beautiful time for the beach. The only thing is that ther is not much to bring with you back that said 'Hey I went to Thailand' but still is a nic eplace to visit. The culture with buda is cool and I personally like it with a giant statue ontop of a small mountain there. </p>

                <img class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" src="download.png">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Carbon emissions from use of fossil fuels fell across the European Union last year, the bloc’s statistics office estimated on Friday, citing COVID-19 restrictions that shut down travel and factories across the region.

                    CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels - such as oil, coal and natural gas - dropped 10% in 2020 compared the previous year, according to Eurostat.

                    Eurostat observed a reduction in oil and oil products consumption in almost all member states, while natural gas consumption fell in 15 countries.

                    "In contrast, the share of renewables (especially wind, hydro and solar) in electricity generation grew considerably," it said.Though emissions fell in each of the EU's 27 member states, Eurostat reported the biggest dips in Greece, Estonia and Luxembourg - all down around 18%.

                    Germany, which generates a quarter of the EU's total CO2 emissions, saw emissions drop nearly 9%, while in Italy, France and Poland, other major CO2 producers, they fell 8% to 11%.

                    The EU’s target to become climate neutral by 2050, helping curb dangerous global warming, will require a green transition in industrial sectors through a take-up of technologies like renewable hydrogen fuel and energy storage.

                    However, courts in France and Germany have ruled that the countries must do more to curb the emissions, while Poland's reluctance to divest from coal has jeopardised its access to the EU's green transition funding.

                    Poland was the only member state not to commit to climate neutrality by 2050 when the bloc set the target in 2019 and the government has long courted political support from interests in coal.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has fined Coastwide Civil Pty Limited $15,000 for an alleged water pollution incident which occurred while conducting dredging work at Shell Cove Boat Harbour.

                    Coastwide Civil was permitted to dredge the harbour for development of a marina. A cut was made in a protective sand bund which opened the harbour to the ocean and resulted in a large visible plume of muddy water discharging from the entrance channel, in March this year.

                    EPA Director Regulatory Operations Jacinta Hanemann said an EPA officer observed the incident.

                    “Visibly dirty and turbid water flowed out of the entrance channel from Shell Cove Boat Harbour into the ocean and resulted in a significant change in the colour of the ocean water for several hundred metres,” Ms Hanemann said.

                    “After being contacted by the EPA, Coastwide Civil closed the opening to stop the discharge.

                    “It is important for all operators to be diligent when performing dredging operations and dealing with sediment rich or muddy water,” Ms Hanemann said.“Muddy water can smother or affect the health of marine plants and animals vital to the local aquatic ecosystem.

                    “Fortunately, the environmental harm from this incident was short-term with the dredging in an area that is not known to contain any pollutants that might have flowed out through the channel.”

                    Penalty notices are one of several tools the EPA can use to achieve environmental compliance including formal warnings, official cautions, license conditions, notices and directions and prosecutions.

                        <p class="p_modal">One Ring, the ring that rules them all, which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.

                            Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy has touched the hearts of young and old alike. Written by Professor J.R.R. Tolkien and consisting of three separate books (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King) The Lord of the Rings was first published by George, Allen and Unwin between 1954 and 1955.

                            And a magnificent achievement it is; an epic tale of friendship, love and heroism, a book that set the benchmark for all fantasy novels to come. Tolkien's descriptive narrative beautifully depicts Middle-earth and the journey that the Fellowship undertakes will remain with them for the rest of their lives.

                            It is hard to put into words the happiness that can be felt when reading a fantasy book as good as this and anybody who has never read it should set aside some time to do so. Is it the best fantasy book of all time? In my opinion, yes.

                            There's no salvation for a fantasy fan who hasn't read the gospel of the genre. The influence of The Lord of the Rings is so universal that everybody from George Lucas to Led Zeppelin has appropriated it for one purpose or another. Not just revolutionary because it was groundbreaking, The Lord of the Rings is timeless because it's the product of a truly top-shelf mind. Tolkien was a distinguished linguist and Oxford scholar of dead languages with strong ideas about the importance of myth and story and a deep appreciation of nature. His epic, 10 years in the making, recounts the Great War of the Ring and the closing of Middle-Earth's Third Age, a time when magic begins to fade from the world and men rise to dominance. Tolkien carefully details this transition with tremendous skill and love, creating in The Lord of the Rings a universal and all-embracing tale, a justly celebrated classic.<br><a href="https://www.bigw.com.au/product/the-fellowship-of-the-ring/p/96709/?store=391&gclid=CjwKCAjw-e2EBhAhEiwAJI5jg4GCNFokfJNUN6lEf-f287fteQ6pw9s3XWkxVlHAZ4bTPyM_AOQsEhoC1DQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><b>BEST BUY LINK!!!</b>

                            You can't hide and protect your child from all the "bad things" in the world, that's just what life is. Kids know and understand more than you think, that's why you have to talk with them, and not make them live in a bubble.
